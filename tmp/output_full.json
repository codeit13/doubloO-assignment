    "reasoning": "Sumit Chauhan has a solid foundation in full stack development with relevant skills in NodeJS, Python, and experience with scalable infrastructure design. His projects demonstrate practical application of software architecture principles and a passion for productivity tools. However, he lacks experience in working on applications with 10,000+ concurrent users and does not have senior-level experience, which are significant gaps for this role. His potential for growth and ability to learn quickly is evident, but the lack of specific experience in real-time applications and open-source contributions limits his fit. Overall, he presents a moderate fit for the position, with the potential for development in the required areas."
