## Detailed Assessment
The candidate, Sumit Chauhan, shows some relevant skills in full-stack development and has contributed to open source projects, which is a positive aspect. However, he lacks critical experience in working with apps that support 10,000+ concurrent users, designing scalable infrastructure, and has not demonstrated experience with real-time applications using OT or CRDT. Additionally, he does not meet the requirement for meaningful time spent as a Senior engineer or higher, nor does he show a clear passion for productivity tools and supporting power users. Overall, while he has some relevant skills, the lack of key required qualifications leads to a conclusion that he is not a fit for the role.
